This is a personal project that employs R and RShiny to create a descriptive dashboard of UNC basketball statistics. It uses the BigBallR package for the data extraction.

The data manipulation and presentation is done through the server.R and ui.R files, respectively. The app.R file is simply the server and ui files combined together, as I wanted to experiment with both ways of running an RShiny application.

The LearningFunctions.R file is used to extract the data since the process takes a long time, and it pushes it into CSVs where the server side can quickly read the updated data.
